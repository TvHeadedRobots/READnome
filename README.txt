READnome is part of a monome animation project that I have been working
on. This project makes use of Processing and the monomic and oscP5 libraries 
to turn the monome into a low resolution display. It will accept any URL or 
file placed in the sketch's data directory and will display it on the monome. 
Each row of the monome represents a single byte on the source file or URL. 
The brightness of the LEDs is also take from the value of the current byte. 
It is an experiment in both low resolution animation and data visualization.
